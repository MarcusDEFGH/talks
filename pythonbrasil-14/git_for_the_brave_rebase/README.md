# Git For The Brave - Rebase

You are a programmer joining a new team and starts studying the Pull Requests and merges between Git's branches: your first reaction is astonishment: "When and where does this feature begin?! Where and when it ends?!" In a world where there is only merge, chaos is the only possible scenario.

We're going to take an exploratory tour of the tool and get rid of some of the myths and fears and see the benefits of using Rebase.
